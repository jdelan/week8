The theme for this week is:

> Native mobile applications

### The Command Line

A few basic commands:

* `cd` (Windows) or `pwd` (Mac)
* `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac)
* `type` (Windows) or `cat` (Mac)
* `run` (Windows) or `open` (Mac)


### Setup

Be sure you have Node 8.9:

`node --version`

If you have 9.0.0, please downgrade by going to https://nodejs.org/en/ and select "8.9.0 LTS".

Make sure you have followed the installation instructions on Canvas for installing `create-react-app` and `yarn` from your command line.

### Our First Native App

Today we will do the following:

  * `npm install -g watchman`
  * `cd hello`
  * `yarn install`
  * `yarn start`

Use the Expo app on your phone to scan the QR code (or enter the URL shown on your screen into your Expo app search bar)
